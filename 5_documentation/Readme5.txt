The only change made based on the professor's feedback was adding the network section to the proposal.
I have highlighted this in the Systems_Requirements document.
No other reports were changed becasue no other changes were possible since no other reports listed below had grades or comments on changes needed before submission of the midterm.
	Module 4 - Customer Problem Statements & System Requirements
	Module 5 - Functional Requirements Specification
	Module 6 - System Sequence Diagram and Activity Diagram
	Module 7 - User Interface Specification

Also, no unit_testing, integration_testing, and data_collection codes or scripts were added.
These look to be things we will cover in Chapter 11. 
I emailed the professor on 3/6 as well as 3/11 asking for clarification and have yet to hear back.

No separate section for the project plan or reference was added either. 
In part of our proposal, we list a plan of work which I believe covers the project plan.
I do not know what is needed in the reference portion at all.
I emailed the professor on 3/11 asking for clarification on both but have yet to hear back.

I am more than happy to make changes to any of the above documents for the midterm and do not wish to lose points,
but feel like I do not have enough information to properly complete the assignment by the due date of 3/17.
I have attempted to contact the professor several times for clarification but have not heard back.

I ask that before lowering my score you provide me with the information needed and I will happily make the changes.
I fear losing points because I do not meet the requirements of the assignment,
but do not know how to meet the requirements and have not been given the direction to do so.
