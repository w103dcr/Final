The only change made based on the professor's feedback was adding the network section to the proposal.
I have highlighted this in the Systems_Requirements document.
No other reports were changed since no other reports listed below had grades or comments on changes needed before submission of the midterm.
	Module 4 - Customer Problem Statements & System Requirements
	Module 5 - Functional Requirements Specification
	Module 6 - System Sequence Diagram and Activity Diagram
	Module 7 - User Interface Specification

No separate section for the reference was added to the Systems_Requirements document either. 
I do not know what is needed in the reference portion at all since there were no references to external documentation.
